This changes shaved off ~10s (from 51s\n  to 39s) on my small test library, but didn't affect the overall\n  performance of the full library scan on my full library. This change\n  in essense minimises the risk of getting all the files at onces timing\n  out and also allows the rest of the symbolic link generation to start\n  earlier.\n\n- Don't check the file system if the file exists every time we iterate\n  the generator. Instead use the list of all known paths we created\n  earlier by converting it to a set and just checking the set. This\n  helps a lot when you're accessing the files over the network.\n\n- Add better logging for when we're generating symbolic links.",
