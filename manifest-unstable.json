By default we let the plugin decide what to do for the main title, alternate title, and description, but each of the three behaviors can be overridden by enabling a checkbox to reveal the new-and-shiny (for the titles at least) advanced selectors. The description selector has also been moved under an override checkbox in this commit, while previously it was always visible.\r\n\r\n- Cleaned up the rest of the metadata settings section to be more tidy by renaming and moving around the other settings.\r\n\r\n- Overhauled the internals to support the new settings. In practice you shouldn't see much difference in behavior compared to the previous options.\r\n\r\n**Warning**: **The title and description settings has been reset to the new default values**, meaning any people that had altered their title/description settings previously should edit them if they don't want to use the new defaults. This is a side-effect of us not having settings migrations. Maybe in the future we will have it, but not now. :slightly_smiling_face",
